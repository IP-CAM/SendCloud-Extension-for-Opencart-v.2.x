Currently we are supporting the default Opencart checkout and the Journal Quickcheckout modules, support for other checkouts will be rolled out in the future.

After selecting the preferred checkout method, click the green ``Apply`` button to roll out the settings, followed by the blue ``Save`` button at the right top corner of the screen to save all the settings.

One or more orders have no shipping details. Check the order information if there is shipping information available. 
Be aware that payment information is not the same as shipping information.

Check the SendCloud Extension's settings. The public key and/or secret key may be blank. If both settings are not blank check if your API keys are correct in the
`SendCloud Panel <https://panel.sendcloud.nl/>`_.

The orders canâ€™t be transported to SendCloud. This occurs when you don't have a suitable shipping method configured in your SendCloud account.
You should contact the `SendCloud support team <contact@sendcloud.nl>`_ if you think that you're not having access to the correct shipping methods.
